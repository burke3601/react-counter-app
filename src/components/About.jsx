        <h1>Dad Joke Bracket</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I created this project as part of my DigitalCrafts Software Development Boot Camp, but also to answer my own dad's questions of, "what are you doing in your coding bootcamp again?"
        </p>

        <p>
            Once I get this hosted, I will send it to my dad's <b>hotmail account</b> (shows you the type of dad we are dealing with here!) so he can discover his favorite dad joke.
        </p>

        Future Goals:<ul>
            <li>Make make bracket component more responsive</li>
            <li>Host the app on a server</li>
            <li>Expand the number of originally fetched jokes</li>
            <li>Incorporate a CSS framework library</li>
            

        </ul>
