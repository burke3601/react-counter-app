# Dad Joke Bracket Challenge

This interactive app allows users to choose their favorite dad joke.

Jokes are randomly fetched from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/. After the bracket is set, the user is able to click through the matchups and crown their dad joke champion.

## Technologies

I used React, JSX, and CSS to complete this app. I will look to add a CSS framework library in a future update.
